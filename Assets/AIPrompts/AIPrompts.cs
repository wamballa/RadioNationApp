 A flat, vibrant square digital illustration in a playful and modern style, designed for a UK radio app. The graphic should feature bold outlines, a stylised retro radio or musical device (e.g. vinyl, boombox, jukebox), and vivid colours matching the UnitedRadio palette (navy blue, red, cream, with accents of pink or purple). Include fun, floating music notes and a strong visual symbol to reflect the category (e.g. hearts for favourites, headphones for all adults, vinyl for Gen X, boombox for millennials). The background should be energetic and consistent with other UI headers, leaving clear space for a text overlay. Style: modern flat vector, pop-illustration, high contrast, punchy and clean
